### Bio
My name is Marko and I'm a web developer. I mainly use PHP, so backend developer. But I do frontend too but I can't call myself a fullstack developer. I like doing javascript since it's a lot of fun.

### What am I doing now?

I'm currently working on a personal project which will go public, it's called AnilistHeaven. It will be an extension for Anilist.co where community will be able to have a lot of fun.
I'm doing front and back, front using VueJS and back using Laravel.
